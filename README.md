# ATMProject_CS19B031
This project was made in NetBeans IDE 12.0 JDK 14

This project is a GUI such that people would find it easy to use it.
There would be additional .form files besides the normal class java files as Netbeans uses form files besides Java files for storing and editing GUI components.

Features provided by the ATM are:
  1. Deposit
  2. Withdraw
  3. View balance
  4. Transfer Funds between accounts
  5. Change PIN 
  6. View Cash remaining in the ATM

The code starts running from the WelcomePage.java class

In the Users.csv file the first column is the Account Number, the second column is the PIN and the third column is the balance

The Cash Dispenser begins with Rs 100000

NOTE: Please don't open the Users.csv file when you press the transfer funds button and the logout button as during that time changes would be made in the file and keeping them    open might cause unexpected errors
NOTE: Also if you are interested in changing the values of the Users.csv File please use notepad++ to ensure the [cr]and[lf] i.e. ('\r' and '\n') are present at the end of each line
